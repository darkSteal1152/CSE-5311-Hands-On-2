# CSE-5311-Hands-On-2
CSE 5311 Assignment 2

Implementations:

1. insertion sort is implemented in the file insertion_sort.py with the corresponding benchmark plot as Figure 2

2. selection sort is implemented in the file selection_sort.py with the corresponding benchmark plot as Figure 3

3. bubble sort is implemented in the file bubble_sort.py with the corresponding benchmark plot as Figure 4

2. Selection sort correctness is shown as a python code in the file selection_sort_correctness.py. The code generates an array and compares the array before and after the selection sort is completed. A final check verifies that the sorted array is truly sorted.

3. As each algorithm is plotted and shown in Figure 2, FIgure 3, and Figure 4, all of the algorithms are grouped and compared in Figure 1 with the code for that plot being in the file main.py . My computer benchmark is as follows:

 IDE: PyCharm
 Programming Language: python
   
   System Information:
Operating System: Windows 11
Processor: Intel i-11700
CPU Cores: 8
Logical CPUs: 16
RAM: 16 GB

Also a txt file console_outputs.txt contains all of the console print statements generated from each of the python files above.
